# Description
This is a 4 hour hackathon project that aimed to build a showcase website for the Google Cloud Vision api. 
The site would allow to take or upload a picture and then the Cloud Vision API would try to recognize as much as possible and the Speech API would speak out the results with , sometimes, a british accent.

The code is dirty, hacky and globally shamefull but aye, when the time is ticking, only the result counts.
